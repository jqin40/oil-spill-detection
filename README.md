# Oil Spill Detection

Trained a ResNet50 CNN to detect marine oil spills, implementing data augmentation techniques with Keras/Tensorflow, as part of the AI4ALL Ignite accelerator.

## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

Oil spills are deterimental to the environment. In the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest oil spill in history, 4.9 million barrels (210 million gallons) of oil were released in the Gulf of Mexico. This oil spill alone is estimated to have killed up to 5 trillion fish, 84 thousand birds, and at least 59 thousand sea turtles (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration). 
We believe that computer vision technology can be used to mitigate the damage to wildlife by identifying images of oil spills to help clean up oil spills around the world.

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

1. Used transfer learning to train a ResNet50 CNN on a 300-image dataset to classify oil spill imagery.
2. Utilized image transformations to generate images based on pre-existing ones.
3. Achieved ~86% validation accuracy after training.

(WORK IN PROGRESS)
(UPDATE IN README.md)

*EXAMPLE:*
*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*
